# How_Salary_Affects_College_Decisions
Trying to determine is students decide on their college major based on the associated salary.

I compared two data sets to see if students enroll in certain majors because of the salary associated with the degree. The first data set called ‘studentsEnrolledByMajor’, and it shows the majors grouped by type and the estimate number of students enrolled along with the margin of error. The second data set is called ‘salaryDegree’ which shows each major and it’s starting salary, mid-career salary and percentiles.
